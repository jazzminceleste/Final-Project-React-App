        "Preference has been a longtime favorite vegan spot for me. Some of my favorite meals are the Western burger, the Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich, Animal style fries...the portions are perfect, the service is exceptional and the wait times aren't ever very long at all. 12/10 recommend dining in, pickup, or delivery!"
